# Recommit

Recommit is a command-line tool that leverages Language Models to automatically regenerate clear, descriptive commit messages for your Git repositories. Say goodbye to writing commit messages manually!

## How does it work?

1. Navigate to your Git repository in the terminal
2. Run the `recommit` command
3. The tool will analyze your commit history and generate improved commit messages based on the actual code changes

## Iterative mode

Recommit includes an interactive mode that ensures safe Git history modifications:

1. Before making any changes, Recommit creates a temporary backup branch of your current state
2. Changes are previewed one commit at a time, allowing you to:
   - Accept the suggested message
   - Edit the suggestion
   - Skip the current commit
   - Keep the original message
3. You can abort the process at any time, which will restore your repository to its original state
4. The backup branch is maintained until you explicitly confirm the changes

This approach guarantees that your Git history remains intact and recoverable, even if:

- The process is interrupted (power failure, nuclear apocalypse, etc.)
- You change your mind about the modifications

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use `recommit --interactive` or `recommit -i` to enable interactive mode

## Development

This project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging. To get started:

1. Install Poetry if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

1. Run the tool:

   ```bash
   poetry run recommit
   ```

## Usage

### Generating commit messages for staged changes

1. Stage your changes with `git add`
2. Run `recommit commit`
3. Review and confirm the generated message

### Rewriting existing commits

1. Navigate to your Git repository
2. Run `recommit rewrite`
3. The tool will analyze your commit history and help you improve previous commit messages
